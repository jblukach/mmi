# mmi

Amazon Linux default installation now starts with about ```175k+``` directories and files. How do we know which files belong on a particular host during the triage of the operating system?

Review enough systems; you start remembering all those Amazon Linux operating system artifacts, just in time for new directories and filenames to end up in the mix or moved to other locations.

The ```mmi``` command line tool lists the current pathâ€™s directories and files based on user access, which are color-coded to help reduce triage time.
